# rocks_snmp
SNMP side channel for statistics retrieval from rocksdb

This is really old code.  It dates from a time when I was playing with
templates and other new toys.

libmevent is a playful library similar in purpose to libevent, but not
as robust.  I do not pretend that it is a worthy comparison.  Again,
it was just for play.

snmpagent actually has had a few good uses for testing and performance
measurement.  This module has actually been used for a couple of
different projects.
